# 202020-Eyesafe-Project
A python project made in 2020 which can be used to safeguard our eyes by making us watch 20m away for 20s each 20min

# Description
This is a serious project (Seriously :hushed:) i made for making sure coders and developers like us do not lose our eyes early.
According to researchers we should use the 20-20-20 formula to take care of our eyes while working continuously onscreen.
It states that we should watch 20m away for 20s every 20mins but we tend to forget when time passes by and it's not great to make an alarm ring every 20min.
That's when this project helps :sunglasses:. It turns the screen off after every 20min for 20s so we just cannot work.
Still if there is emergency work going on we can just move our mouse/cursor/press any key on keyboard to wake the screen up again.

## System Requirements
1. Windows OS
2. pywin32 has to be installed and initiated as follows
- Run `pip install pywin32`
- Go to the folder where python is installed
- Make sure there is the Scripts folder
- Open cmd to that location and run `Scripts\pywin32_postinstall.py -install`
- That's it requirements complete. Now test out the project.

## Instructions to run the project
1. Clone or Download the project to your PC.
2. Pip install all the required libraries 
`pip install time threading`
3. Run the bg file if you want the program to run in background or else run the normal file

## Working
The code simply has a timer which turns off the screen after every 20mins and then turns it on again after 20s
